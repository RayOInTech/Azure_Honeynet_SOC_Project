# Implementing a SOC and Honeynet in Azure 

Introduction:
____________
I am excited to share my latest project: a cutting-edge honeynet built in Azure to simulate and analyze real-world cyberattacks. This project demonstrates the use of tcpdump, a powerful command-line network traffic analysis tool. By capturing and analyzing network packets, this project explores how to identify bandwidth usage, detect anomalies, and filter traffic based on custom criteria. The Azure Honeypot Project showcases the deployment and configuration of a honeypot within an Azure environment to attract and analyze malicious activity. 

This project explores setting up a cloud-based honeypot, collecting telemetry data, and analyzing attack patterns to bolster defensive strategies making it a versatile tool for network administrators and cybersecurity enthusiasts.

With a focus on cloud security and threat intelligence, this repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding and mitigating modern cyber threats.
