# Implementing a SOC and Honeynet in Azure 

Introduction:
____________
I am excited to share my latest project: a cutting-edge honeynet built in Azure to simulate and analyze real-world cyberattacks. This project demonstrates the use of tcpdump, a powerful command-line network traffic analysis tool. By capturing and analyzing network packets, this project explores how to identify bandwidth usage, detect anomalies, and filter traffic based on custom criteria. The project also integrates Bash scripting to automate common traffic inspection tasks, making it a versatile tool for network administrators and cybersecurity enthusiasts.
